## Installation

### Requirements:
- Python 3.6+
- Pip (Python package manager)

### Steps:

1. Clone or download the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/DarkProbe.git
   ```

2. Install the required libraries:
   Navigate to the project folder and run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Place the necessary wordlists in the `wordlists` directory:
   - `passwords.txt`: The password list for SSH brute force.
   - `directories.txt`: The list of directories to try for directory brute forcing.

## Usage

To run the tool, use the `main.py` file. The script will prompt the user for input and execute the corresponding security features. Here are the available modules:

### Network Scan:
Perform a network scan on a specific IP or host.
```bash
python main.py -n <target-ip>
```

### SSH Brute Force:
Perform an SSH brute force attack on a target server using the `passwords.txt` wordlist.
```bash
python main.py -b <target-ip>
```
To specify a custom wordlist, use the `-w` flag:
```bash
python main.py -b <target-ip> -w <custom_passwords.txt>
```

### Hash Cracking (MD5):
Crack an MD5 hash to reveal the original password.
```bash
python main.py -H <md5_hash>
```

### Directory Brute Force:
Perform a directory brute force attack on a website.
```bash
python main.py -d <website-url>
```
To specify a custom directory wordlist, use the `-w` flag:
```bash
python main.py -d <website-url> -w <custom_directories.txt>
```

## Ethical Usage Guidelines

**DarkProbe** should only be used for ethical and authorized testing. It is designed for penetration testers, security researchers, and cybersecurity professionals. Unauthorized use may be illegal. Here are the ethical guidelines:

1. **Do not use without permission**: Only use **DarkProbe** on systems or networks for which you have explicit permission. Unauthorized use may lead to legal consequences.
2. **Limit your scope**: Only scan systems or networks that you have permission to test.
3. **Protect personal data**: Do not attempt to crack or access personal or sensitive data without consent.
4. **Follow the law**: Ensure that penetration testing and security testing are legally permitted in your region.

## Flags and Modules

Here are the flags you can use with the **DarkProbe** tool:

- `-n` or `--network`: Perform a network scan on a specific IP or host.
- `-b` or `--bruteforce`: Perform an SSH brute force attack on a target server.
- `-H` or `--hash`: Crack an MD5 hash to reveal the original password.
- `-d` or `--directory`: Perform a directory brute force attack on a website.
- `-w` or `--wordlist`: Specify a custom wordlist for brute force or directory scanning.

Example usage:
```bash
python main.py -b <target-ip> -w custom_passwords.txt
python main.py -d <website-url> -w custom_directories.txt
```

## Future Improvements

Here are some future features or improvements that could be added to **DarkProbe**:

1. **Multi-threading/Concurrency**: Speed up brute force or scanning operations.
2. **Support for More Hash Algorithms**: Add support for cracking more types of hashes (e.g., SHA-1, SHA-256).
3. **Custom Output Directories**: Allow users to specify where the results should be saved.
4. **Advanced Scanning Features**: Add more network scanning capabilities (e.g., port scanning).
5. **GUI Interface**: Add a graphical user interface to make the tool more accessible.
6. **Password Strength Estimation**: Estimate the strength of passwords before brute-forcing them.
7. **Integration with Wordlist Repositories**: Directly download wordlists from repositories like SecLists or CrackStation.
